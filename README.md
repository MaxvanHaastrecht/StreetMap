# Street Map

Based on .shp and .shx files of roads in a certain country, create images representing the roads in selected cities and show them in an image grid.

Dutch road files can be found [here](https://mapcruzin.com/free-netherlands-arcgis-maps-shapefiles.htm), for example. The .shp file is too large to host on git :sob:. StreetMap.py assumes you have the .shp and .shx files you want to use in your current directory.

Below is the result of creating individual images with StreetMap.py and then combining them with ImageGrid.py, for the Dutch cities of Doetinchem \(top-left\), Groningen\(top-right\), Zwolle\(bottom-left\) and Utrecht \(bottom-right\).
